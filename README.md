Navigating to your elasticsearch/bin directory and using the appropriate release tag or the master branch for ES 2.x users:


```
./plugin install royrusso/elasticsearch-HQ
```

Or for a specific branch:

```
./plugin install royrusso/elasticsearch-HQ/v1.0.0
```
 
Requirements
------------
* A Web Browser.
* A running instance of ElasticSearch with reachable REST endpoint.

Elasticsearch 5.0
-----------------

Site plugins are [not supported](https://www.elastic.co/blog/running-site-plugins-with-elasticsearch-5-0) in Elasticsearch 5.0 and you have to host ElasticHQ by your self ([nginx example](example/nginx_es_5.conf)).

Enabling CORS
-------------
You most likely need to enable CORS on your Elasticsearch yml configs for this plugin to work if using it from outside of the cluster. 

```
http.cors.enabled : true
http.cors.allow-origin : "*"
http.cors.allow-methods : OPTIONS, HEAD, GET, POST, PUT, DELETE
http.cors.allow-headers : X-Requested-With,X-Auth-Token,Content-Type, Content-Length
```
